## Introduction

Maji Ndogo faces a severe water crisis impacting its population's daily lives and safety. With limited water access and associated challenges like long queues and high crime rates, the situation demands urgent interventions. This project analyzes key metrics related to water access, crime, and project budgets to offer actionable recommendations. By leveraging Power BI, we aim to support tailored solutions and efficient resource allocation.

## Goals and Key Questions

### Goals:
- To understand the extent of water access challenges and infrastructure deficits.
- To evaluate the relationship between water access and crime.
- To provide insights for efficient budget allocation and project prioritization.

### Key Questions:
1. What percentage of the population has basic water access, and what disparities exist?
2. How do long queues for water impact daily life and safety?
3. Which regions require the most urgent interventions?
4. Are resources being allocated efficiently for improvement projects?
5. How does crime relate to water scarcity in Maji Ndogo?

## Recommendations and Future Plans

### Recommendations:
1. **Focus on Rural Access**: Increase investments in rural regions with minimal water infrastructure.
2. **Reduce Queue Times**: Expand shared water sources to decrease the burden on vulnerable populations.
3. **Address Crime Hotspots**: Implement security measures at water collection points to ensure safety.
4. **Vendor Accountability**: Monitor vendor performance and establish strict guidelines to improve efficiency.

### Future Plans:
- Develop predictive models to assess the long-term impact of water interventions.
- Enable real-time monitoring of queue times and water access through IoT-enabled systems.
- Explore alternative water sources like rainwater harvesting for sustainable solutions.
